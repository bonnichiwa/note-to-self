						<p>What I want to show you isn’t with words though, it’s with these images I’ve collected. People go places and take pictures, some take really nice ones. I do that too, maybe not particularly really nice, but that’s not what I’m here to share. I’m here to share those moments where I’ve seen something and literally in my mind think ‘wow this looks like it came from a comic book!’. I’m more interested in those moments rather than a perfectly captured snapshot with the 5th filter on Instagram with 20% fade and cropped with a 1 to 1 ratio. The daily lives of people and unruly buildings and landscapes of abnormal proportions.  I’ve been to 20...something countries and it’s still so mind boggling peoples’ lives can be so different! I’m here to share those moments, not of monumental buildings but of flashes of life in a random place at a random time completely un-framed and in its rawest form. To make it seem like ‘wow this looks like it came from a comic book!’ kind of feel, but it very much is real life. To bring forth the mind-boggleness of my world distorted through all my travels. Through my eyes. Through my iPhone 7 lens and then converted through my wonky way of amateur illustrations. </p>

						<p class="note-title">Shimla, India, December 2017</p>
						<p>It's chillier than I thought it would be, and I definitely didn't bring thick enough sweaters. 
							To keep myself warm I've been drinking "masala chai" here <i>everyday</i>.</p>
						<p>Not that I mind.</p>
						<p>There's a lot of initimate shops here, one or two tables seating max. It's a nice change.
							No big chains, no noise. Just good tea and good conversations.</p>
						<p>Sometimes there's not even tea. Grab a friend, kick back, and have a chat.</p>
